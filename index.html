          Watches, rings and fitness bands can now act like payment cards. This page explains how wearables are linked to your credit card, what “tokenization” means, and which limits and security checks typically sit in the background.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Wearable Payment Device?</h2>
      <p>A wearable payment device is any object you wear – like a smartwatch, ring, bracelet or fitness band – that can complete a card transaction at a contactless terminal. Instead of a plastic card, the device holds a <strong>payment token</strong> linked to your card account.</p>
      <p>Under the surface, these payments still run on standard card networks (Visa, Mastercard, etc.). The difference is <strong>where</strong> the token lives and <strong>how</strong> you authenticate: tapping your wrist or ring instead of inserting or tapping a physical card.</p>
      <p>Wearables are mainly about <strong>convenience and form factor</strong>. The underlying billing, interest and card terms remain those of your original credit card or debit card.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Devices -->
    <section id="devices" class="section">
      <h2>Common Types of Wearable Payment Devices</h2>
      <p>Wearable payments can be built into different form factors. The most common categories include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Smartwatches:</strong> Devices with their own OS and apps, often using the same wallet system as your phone.</li>
        <li><strong>Rings and jewelry:</strong> Dedicated payment rings or bracelets that embed an NFC chip and token, usually with limited controls.</li>
        <li><strong>Fitness bands:</strong> Activity trackers that add payment functionality alongside health features.</li>
        <li><strong>Passive wearables:</strong> Accessories with no battery or display that simply hold a tokenized card credential.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Regardless of form factor, the core idea is the same: a <strong>device-specific token</strong> stands in for your regular card number at the point of sale.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mechanics -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Wearable Card Payments Actually Work</h2>
      <p>Most wearable payments follow a similar flow:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Provisioning:</strong> You add a card to the device or its companion app. The issuer and wallet provider create a token that represents your card.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> The real card number is not stored on the wearable. Instead, the token and cryptographic keys live in a secure element or trusted environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Tap to pay:</strong> When you tap the wearable on a terminal, it sends the token and a one-time cryptogram via NFC.</li>
        <li><strong>Network &amp; issuer checks:</strong> The card network and issuer validate the token, cryptogram, available limit and risk signals before authorizing.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>From the merchant’s perspective, it still looks like an ordinary card transaction. The difference is that the card details came from a <strong>tokenized wearable</strong> instead of a plastic card.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Security -->
    <section id="security" class="section">
      <h2>Security, Limits and Risk Considerations</h2>
      <p>Wearable payments are not automatically “safer” or “less safe” than cards – they are just <strong>different</strong>. Important angles to understand:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tokenization:</strong> The device uses a token rather than your real card number, which can reduce exposure if the device is compromised.</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Some wearables rely on a phone or watch lock (PIN/biometrics), others use simple proximity. The level of protection varies.</li>
        <li><strong>Contactless limits:</strong> Many markets have limits for low-value “tap” transactions without extra authentication. Wearables may be subject to the same rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Remote disable:</strong> If you lose the device, you can usually revoke the token from your bank or wallet app without cancelling the underlying card.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The main risk is <strong>treating the wearable like jewellery instead of a payment instrument</strong>. It should still be locked, monitored and deactivated if lost.</p>
