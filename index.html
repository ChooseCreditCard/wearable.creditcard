  <!-- Overview -->
  <section id="overview" class="section">
    <h2>What Counts as a Wearable Payment?</h2>
    <p>Wearable payments happen when a smartwatch, fitness tracker, payment ring or similar device transmits a tokenized version of your credit-card credentials at a terminal. Instead of storing your card number, the device uses a unique payment token provisioned by your issuer or wallet provider.</p>
    <p>These tokens allow the device to mimic a contactless card, but with stronger security: if stolen or copied, they can be revoked instantly without replacing your physical card.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Mechanics -->
  <section id="mechanics" class="section">
    <h2>How Wearable Payments Flow at the Terminal</h2>
    <p>When you tap a wearable, it sends an NFC signal carrying a token and cryptographic authentication data. The terminal forwards this through the payment gateway to the card network, which checks with your issuer whether the token is valid and unblocked.</p>
    <p>The issuer verifies the token, applies fraud and risk scoring, and approves or declines. All this happens in a fraction of a second — similar to contactless card transactions, but using a more secure credential stored in the device’s secure element.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Device Security, Tokens & Authentication</h2>
    <p>Wearables rely on a “secure element”, a small tamper-resistant chip that stores your tokenized credentials. This ensures that even if the device is compromised, the actual card number is never exposed.</p>
    <p>Most wearables require device-level authentication (PIN, pattern, or wrist detection) to unlock payment mode. If removed from your wrist, the device usually disables payments until you authenticate again.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Limits, Compatibility & Real-World Constraints</h2>
    <p>Not all wearables support all card networks or issuers. Some rely on Apple Pay or Google Wallet provisioning; others use proprietary tokenization platforms. Compatibility varies by region, device model and card type.</p>
    <p>Tap-to-pay limits, offline transaction caps and merchant terminal configurations may also affect acceptance — especially in countries with older terminals or strict SCA rules.</p>
