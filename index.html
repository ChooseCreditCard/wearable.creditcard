    <h2>What Counts as a Wearable Payment?</h2>
    <p>Wearable payments happen when your card credentials live inside a device you wear instead of the plastic card itself. Common examples:</p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Smartwatches linked to a wallet (Apple Watch, Wear OS, etc.).</li>
      <li>Payment rings & bands with integrated secure chips.</li>
      <li>Fitness trackers or other devices with NFC payment modules.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The terminal still sees a standard contactless card transaction — the difference lies in where the card token is stored and how it is authenticated.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="tech" class="section">
    <h2>Secure Elements, Tokens & Wallets</h2>
    <p>Under the hood, most wearable card payments rely on:</p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Secure elements:</strong> tamper-resistant hardware chips storing payment tokens.</li>
      <li><strong>Network tokens:</strong> card-network issued substitutes for your real card number.</li>
      <li><strong>Wallet provisioning:</strong> issuer and network approve each device before it can pay.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When you tap your watch or ring, the device sends a tokenized “card” to the terminal using NFC, not your raw PAN.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Authentication on Wearables</h2>
    <p>Authentication flows differ slightly from phone-based wallets:</p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Many watches use a <strong>wrist detection + PIN</strong> model: unlock once, stay trusted while worn.</li>
      <li>Rings and minimalist wearables may rely on phone-level authentication at provisioning time.</li>
      <li>Back-end systems still run risk checks and may require SCA on the paired phone for some transactions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This design aims to balance convenience (tap and go) with strong security for adding and managing cards.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Limits, Offline Behaviour & Reliability</h2>
    <p>Wearables inherit many properties from standard contactless cards, with some nuances:</p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Contactless limits from the card scheme and local regulation still apply.</li>
      <li>In semi-offline environments (e.g. transport), wearables behave similar to cards or phones.</li>
      <li>If the device battery dies, the payment function usually stops working.</li>
      <li>Some devices support multiple cards and can switch between them, others are single-card.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For critical travel or high-value purchases, you should still carry at least one physical backup card.</p>
